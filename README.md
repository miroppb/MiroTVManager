# MiroTVManager

Hello, and welcome to this project.
May not be the most sophisticated TV Manager, but hey, I made this a few years ago to keep up with the shows that I watch, on theTVDB.com.

Plus, the theTVDB API is widely used, so, why not.

You'll need to get a Key at https://thetvdb.com/dashboard/account/apikey, before you can use this TV Manager to its full potential.

This Manager can:

* Search for shows on theTVDB.com
