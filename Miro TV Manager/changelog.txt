**Miro TV Manager** Changelog

	-1.9.0 (April 6, 2014): I guess this is a good time as any to start version 2. Since version 1's files corrupted, I having to rewrite version 2. Not completely from scratch, but still most of the things will be rewritten. Hopefully no bugs :)
		+ Main Window's design looks complete
		+ Search button is more interactive, with an iPhone-styled "clear" button
	-1.9.2 (April 9, 2014):
		+ Fetches the correct files before processing. Previously the banner would be called in the middle, now first.
		+ Figured out code for removing image. Will be helpful when doing "Clear Cache".
		+ Copied most of the code from v1, changing some things.
		+ Adding items to the list is done with about 100 less lines of code than v1.
		+ Seems faster than v1 (after clicking Search), but then again, its mere seconds.
	-1.9.4 (April 11, 2014):
		+ Using a RichTextbox to show the Episode Description, with Series Title/S?E?/Ep.Name formatted bold.
		+ Notification Bubble works.
		+ Realizing how awesome a Dictionary is!
		+ Added color to the Up/Down arrow
		+ The favorites are fetched from TheTVDB.com, saved (along with their banners), and added to the top list.
	-1.9.5 (April 12, 2014):
		+ Fixed up the Top Series list, when the amount of favorites isn't a multiple of 5.
		+ Arrow keys can now be used to move up and down the Top Series list :)
	1.9.5.1 (April 13, 2014):
		+ Bug fixes, and optimization of code.
	1.9.5.5 (April 14, 2014):
		+ Forgot to close file readers in some locations, this would have given an error when clearing cache or force updating. Fixed.
		+ Fixed code, where the air-date was empty, and the program would make the next air-date today's date.
		+ Prevented multiple episode selections. Would have caused an error.
		+ Fixed code, that would have given an error if episodes were selected in quick succession.
		+ The images now have corresponding tool-tips, Series and their Delete buttons.
		+ Settings are now read/saved upon opening/closing settings. Last method was buggy.
		+ If viewing episode description, arrow keys will move up/down the episode-list instead of episode-list and top-series-list. Click on something else/press tab, to give control to the top-series-list.
		+ When closing the Manager, the tray-icon will go away. Previously didn't.
	1.9.6 (April 15, 2014):
		+ Found another bug, where if AirTime isn't set, it would cause an error. Fixed by omitting that section if an error occurs.
		+ Adding/Removing a series to/from favorites works :) Easier than I thought.
		+ Created the About window. Added some background information: how the application came to be, and where I get the series' info from.
		+ Amazingly still below 1,000 lines of code. Not for long...as soon as the timing starts...ho ho ho, hold on to your sides!
	1.9.7 (April 16-18, 2014):
		+ Settings are saved along with the Title and SxE of next episode.
		+ Settings window now has a list of all TV Series, along with options to get notified before/after.
		+ Settings are correctly retrieved and applied.
		+ New settings are correctly stored and saved.
		+ "Apply to All" works :)
	1.9.8 (April 20, 2014):
		+ Added timer that checks if a series (that was selected in settings) is about to air or has already aired.
		+ Automatically updates at 6AM (will have to test).
		+ Guess I'll have to wait and see if it does what its supposed to do :)
	1.9.9 (April 23 - 30, 2014):
		+ Fixed bug where the wrong upcoming episode SxE and Title were displayed when searching
		+ Application should work if the user doesn't have TheTVDB.com account, although it is recommended to get one.
		+ Implemented Prowl, but will have to wait to test...
		+ When searching, an auto-complete is shown with titles of favorite series, and when the current-searched series is a favorite, the list moves up/down to show it.
		+ Decided to sort the series, instead of displaying as they were added to the list. Will have to change some things now :-/
		+ When TheTVDB ID isn't set or there are no favorites, the section for Notifications in Settings becomes hidden.
		+ Fixed bugs when saving settings.
		+ Fixed bugs when notifying about upcoming/aired episode
		+ Fixed bug when Force Updating, a variable wasn't being cleared, and caused the amount of series to be exceptionally large.
		+ Shows Next Show that will air (click to show in overview)
	2.0.0 (April, 30, 2014):
		+ Published to http://miroppb.com/projects/TVManager/
	2.0.1.1 (May 1, 2014):
		+ I guess I didn't fully test, found messedup code in settings when applying "Before" to all.
	2.0.2 (May 2, 2014):
		+ Apparently I thought the code was working without fully testing it lol.
		+ Found bug when adding/removing a series, some things weren't saved properly.
	2.0.3 (May 3, 2014):
		+ Encountered something I haven't before: series that have no banners. Fixed by creating a "no banner" image.
	2.0.3.1 (May 6, 2014):
		+ Fixed a bug that was causing newly searched series' banners to be "No Banner"
	2.0.3.6 (June 11, 2014):
		+ Fixed a bug, where if a new series was searched, that had no AirDate, it would throw an error. Fixed.
	2.0.3.7 (June 11, 2014):
		+ Bug with the Delete button on the search textbox. Wouldn't show for some reason, after last update. Fixed by bringing it to the front.
	2.0.3.8 (July 25, 2014):
		+ Bug where the image for "No Banner" was deleted during Clear Cache/Force Update, and caused an error to popup. Fixed by not deleting it.
	2.0.3.9 (August 10, 2014):
		+ When a series is searched/clicked that already exists in Favorites, the "Add to Favorites" button is now disabled.
		+ If a series has ended, and the user still wants to add it to their favorites, the popup message warns them that the series has ended.
		+ A small text now shows up below the "Add to Favorites" button that warns that the current series has ended.
	2.0.4.0 (September 19, 2014):
		+ Apparantly I forgot to publish this update a few weeks ago. My bad
		+ When series are being updated, the application checks for series that have ended. If some have, pops up recommending their removal.
		+ Fix where after viewing a series that has ended, the text "Series has ended" kept displaying even when viewing a current series.
		+ Fixed the math for the progress bar when updating series. Potentially, if a user had >100 series, there would have been an error.
	2.0.4.1 (Septemper 21, 2014):
		+ Fixed major bug: If the series is new, and the first episode is yet to air, the popup balloon would say the wrong air-time.
		+ Thanks to the bug mentioned above, this fixed some popup balloons that didn't show for upcoming episodes.
		+ Added some code, that will give me more info about errors, so I can hopefully fix them faster in the future
	2.0.4.2 (September 30, 2014):
		+ Added a version checker, which checks if a new version of the application is available. If yes, asks to restart to update.
		+ Previously, when an error occured when saving settings, it would delete the settings file, erasing the thetvdb.com and Prowl ID.
			Application now saves the IDs, so user doesn't have to retrieve them again.
	2.0.4.3 (October 12, 2014):
		+ Fixed program logic bug, when Force Updating. The images weren't disposed of in the correct order.
		+ Fixed version checker: 1) Extended timer to 24 hours, 2) Accommodated code for when the version was returned as null.
		+ About window's version and years are generated automatically, instead of me having to change them manually each time.
	2.0.4.4 (November 1, 2014):
		+ Fixed bug where the application would crash if a series had no air-time.
	2.0.4.5 (December 16, 2014):
		+ Stopped crash when something was wrong with the episode description. Didn't look for the problem, just did try/catch :P
	2.0.4.6 (January 15, 2015):
		+ Stopped crash when settings were being written, but the file was already somehow in use. Useless line of code, removed.
	2.0.4.7 (February 3, 2015):
		+ Always some minor detail need to be fixed lol.
		+ Series Description was retrieved from search results, /and/ from series info. Removed retrieval from results, as it doesn't always have the Description (idk why).
	2.0.4.8 (February 12, 2015):
		+ Series that have been recently announced, and don't have airtimes or airdates, will cause an error to appear while the application is starting.
			Fixed by setting default variables (1 month ago, 0x0, etc.), and skipping the file reading.
	2.0.5.0 (February 13, 2015):
		+ New feature: the banners are now semi-transparent, and when a series is selected, a fanart replaces the background, also semi-transparent. Looks nice IMO.
	2.0.5.1 (March 5, 2015):
		+ Fixed bug where if the first show on top list was the next to air, and it was clicked on, it would cause an error, because some variables weren't set.
		+ Added "Check for Update" under the ? on the Menu Strip, to manually check for update.
	2.0.5.2 (March 28, 2015):
		+ That moment when you see a bug, you go through your code to find it, and realize you randomly added code...and that code is the bug :D. Removed 2 lines of "why is that there" code.
	2.0.5.3 (June 8, 2015):
		+ When Force Updating, I forgot to remove the fanart from the background, and an error was shown. The fanart is now disposed and default image is shown.
	2.0.5.4: (August 16, 2015):
		+ A little problem, I coded the way the application checks whether to download new updates kinda wrong, so it would keep using old information, unless a Force Update was initiated.
			Fixed by changing && to || (and to or). Smart me :D
	2.0.5.5: (January 27, 2016):
		+ When doing a Force Update, the application didn't properly dispose of the background image, and would crash. Fixed by disposing properly
	3.0.0.0: (August 8, 2016):
		+ Complete rewrite
